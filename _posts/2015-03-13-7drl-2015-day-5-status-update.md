## The story so far

<ul class="task-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Saturday:</strong> Suddenly realize it is the week of the 7drl challenge.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sunday:</strong> Never made a game before. No detailed plans. Decide to try anyway. Start coding at around 11:30 PM&#8230;
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Monday (Day 1):</strong> Have been working on another Javascript project recently so I feel like I have momentum. I&#8217;ll use RoT.js.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the tutorial at Coding Cookies to get a foundation. Strip out stuff I don&#8217;t need like inventory and experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    Start on gameplay idea based loosely on card games. You randomly draw a hand of cards (prayers, spells, whatever). You can only &#8216;play&#8217; so many per turn/level/whatever. Not straying too far from the basic roguelike formula as I&#8217;m expecting a lot of effort just to make a game that works.
  </li>
  <li>
    Got an @ walking around in a dungeon.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tuesday:</strong> I need a theme. Anything but goblins. I dunno, lobsterfolk? Sure. Sounds good. Ooh, and they can have an Atlantissy dungeon. And the player&#8217;s god and abilities can be sea themed. Okay, this works.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a few lobsterfolk enemies and start working on abilities system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wednesday:</strong> Didn&#8217;t have a lot of time today. Implement a few abilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Thursday:</strong> Implement more abilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Today:</strong> Still need a title.Â  Probably going with Chitinous Crooks.
  </li>
</ul>
