Last week, Dev Bootcamp asked us to look at a list of values and pick which values came to mind at the times when we were most satisfied with our lives. I won't replicate the huge list in this post, but here's my personal top 3 right now. Personal development. Creativity. Challenge.

I haven't always tried to live up to these values as much as I would like, but I've been taking steps to change that lately. I've been pushing myself to take on more projects and create new things. And I've learned a lot in the process.

Just this past weekend, I focused my efforts on creating a game within three days for the Ludum Dare 33 game jam. It turned out to be kind of a weird game, but I finished it and you can see it [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=56320). And it wasn't just fun and games. I came out of it having learned more about the Handlebars.js template system. Cool.

Anyway, I think facing challenges, be they big or small, helps me to keep in mind that I can get things done when I put my mind to it.  When someone doubts me, instead of letting it bother me, I can remember that this is just another challenge to face like I've done before. And even if I don't succeed (hey it happens to the best of us), I'll have learned something new for the next time.
