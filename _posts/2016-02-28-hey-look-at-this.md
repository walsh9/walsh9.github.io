Sometimes I want to share a few Tweets or other things as a group. But usually something like Storify is overkill for what I'm sharing. So I made this minimalist tool that can share Tweets and a few other types of social media posts as embeds.

Just type in something like this:

![Hey, look at this composing.](/i/hlat-before.png)

You'll get a giant link that looks like this:

[http://walsh9.github.io/hey-look-at-this/#-&You%20can%20share%20tweets&-&t=608692357953896448&t=680491464657387520&-&And%20Other%20stuff&-&s=walsh9/messing-around-with-the-bleep-labs-nebulophone](http://walsh9.github.io/hey-look-at-this/#-&You%20can%20share%20tweets&-&t=608692357953896448&t=680491464657387520&-&And%20Other%20stuff&-&s=walsh9/messing-around-with-the-bleep-labs-nebulophone)

That link will take anyone to a page that looks like this:

![Hey, look at this viewing.](/i/hlat-after.png)

It's still a work in progress but I'm happy with what it does so far.
