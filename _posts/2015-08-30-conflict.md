Dealing with conflict isn't my strong point. In fact, I like to consider myself pretty good at avoiding conflict. But when it comes down to it, that same interpersonal conflict avoidance can sometimes be to my own detriment. If something's bothering me I'll usually silently let it go rather than bring up the issue and invite a potential conflict. This is fine, and even a good thing, when the issue is something trivial.  

But when I remain silent about things that really bothers me, I'll dwell on the problem and let the stress build up. These unaddressed issues can suddenly pop into my head and distract me and generally make me feel worse. 

When someone does or says something that bothers me, I need to be able to identify what's really important to me and let the rest go. I need to speak up more when it's appropriate, and find constructive ways to vent when it's not. Overall, when something comes up it's really important to remember to take time to stop and reflect on why I feel the way I do. I'm going to try to remember this going forward.
