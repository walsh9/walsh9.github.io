I just finished the 2016 [7DRL Challenge](http://7drl.org). My game is called [Bisbee's Escape](http://walsh9.github.io/7drl2016/). It's inspired by games like Dig Dug, Mr. Do, and Digger. Your only weapon is crates you can drop on enemies. But these crates have different effects for you to discover.

I didn't have as much time as I wanted to work on it this year so it's a little rough around the edges. But it's playable enough and I hope to fix all the outstanding bugs in a later post-challenge release. [Go check it out!](http://walsh9.github.io/7drl2016/)
