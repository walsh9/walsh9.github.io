A few weeks ago I attempted the 2017 [7DRL Challenge](http://7drl.org). I worked on a kaiju roguelike called [Gigastomp](https://walsh9.github.io/7drl2017). Inspired by the feel of classic Godzilla films I had some big plans.

To be fair to myself, I did finish off the week with something that can be technically called a game. You can win, you can lose, you can breathe energy beams, etc. But the end product feels unfinished, unbalanced, an unfun. It's a nice tech demo and if this was my first year doing the challenge I might even count it as a success. But it's just so far from where I want it to be.

I think what went wrong was I spent too much time debugging the game engine. First, I was experimenting with making multi-tile actors. I want these monsters to be big! But there was more to account for there than I expected. Experiments with animations and events that caused chain reactions of more animations also took a lot of time to debug. I think the takeaway for next year is to spend less time experimenting with technology so I have more time to experiment with gameplay.

Anyway, it's not so fun yet but I'm going to continue to improve it. You can [try it anyway](https://walsh9.github.io/7drl2017) if you want. At least it looks cool.
