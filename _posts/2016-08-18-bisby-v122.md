I just deployed an update to [Bisby's Escape](http://walsh9.github.io/7drl2016/), the game that I made a few months ago for the 2016 7-day roguelike challenge. I fixed a bunch of bugs and added animated movement and sound effects. No real gameplay changes yet, but I think the animation and sound makes it a lot easier to read what is going on on the screen.

I'm planning for the next release to have new types of crates and more varied level generation, but I wanted to get these features in first.
