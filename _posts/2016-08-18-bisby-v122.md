I just deployed an update to [the game](http://walsh9.github.io/7drl2016/) I worked on a few months ago for the 7-day roguelike challenge. I fixed a bunch of bugs and added animated movement and a bunch of sound effects. No real gameplay changes yet, but I hope to have some new stuff for the next release after this.
