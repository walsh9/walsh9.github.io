Just got this in the mail last weekend.

It's a little wifi enabled programmable chip thing with a cloud service behind it.

You can program it from a web based interface. You can make it publish and subscribe to cloud events and use the API to connect it to your own web apps. But my favorite part is the [IFTTT][1] support. It makes connecting it with all sorts of existing stuff super fast and easy.

I only played with it for like 15 minutes so far, but with the help of some example code and the IFTTT phone app I was able to get this killer app working.

Can you guess what the button does?

Amazing, right?
