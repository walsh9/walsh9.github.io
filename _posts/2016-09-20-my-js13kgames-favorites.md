I finally played through 100+ [js13kgames](http://2016.js13kgames.com/entries) entries. It was hard to narrow it down but here are some of my favorites.

- [Bubble Trap](http://js13kgames.com/entries/bubble-trap) - A clever puzzle game about editing levels to control the paths of bubbles. I had to stop playing when telling colors apart got more important, but what I played was really well done.
- [Evil Glitch](http://js13kgames.com/entries/evil-glitch) - Really polished arena shooter. Maybe just me but I'm feeling kind of a 2D Devil Daggers vibe.
- [Fix the Glitch](http://js13kgames.com/entries/fix-the-glitch) - Go into the computer zone and solve an assortment of neat computer themed puzzle minigames.
- [Glitch Blob](http://js13kgames.com/entries/glitch-blob) - Addictive fish tank simulator. Amazing use of CSS for the graphics.
- [Glitch in outer space](http://js13kgames.com/entries/glitch-in-outer-space) - Top down puzzle adventure game just full of atmosphere. I got stuck but I want to come back to this one.
- [Glitchformer](http://js13kgames.com/entries/glitchformer) - I won't spoil it but the glitch mechanic in this game is so great. Would love to see it expanded upon.
- [Phosphorous Dating](http://js13kgames.com/entries/phosphorus-dating) - Match up 90s couples based on their profiles. Strangely immersive. Super-polished retro-Windows UI.
- [Super Chrono Portal Maker](http://js13kgames.com/entries/super-chrono-portal-maker) - A puzzle platformer that has it all.
- [Theo's Escape](http://js13kgames.com/entries/theos-escape) - Great looking one-button platformer. Don't give up at the cogs! There's more to see!
- [GLITCHICKEN](http://js13kgames.com/entries/glitchicken) - Fantastic use of the theme. Abuse glitches in collision code and more to make your escape.
- [Tonder](http://js13kgames.com/entries/tonder) - A really clever take on Guess Who where the game gives you the answers and have to figure out the question. All wrapped up in a super-slick dating app UI.
