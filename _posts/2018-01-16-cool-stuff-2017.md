Whew, got through another year. Time to take a breath and look back. Here's some cool things I made in 2017.

## Games

Well, I tried.

### Gigastomp (Unfinished)

This is a game I started making for the 2017 [Seven-Day Roguelike Challenge](http://7drl.org/). I didn't really get it polished to the point where I was happy calling it a success but it's [technically playable](https://walsh9.github.io/7drl2017/). I still need to add more features, fix a lot of bugs, and add a whole lot of polish. But there's also parts of the underlying code I want to rewrite completely so who knows when I'll come back to this.

### Shepherds of Io (Unfinished)

I started on this for the 2017 [js13kgames](http://js13kgames.com/) contest, and this one got _nowhere near_ playable. On the plus side it looks cool and is way under 13kb in its current state.

### Dragon Tax Return Simulator 2015 Auditor's Cut Update

I finally added some small things I'd been meaning to add. Specifically a little claw cursor and a better endgame summary. This is the definitive version of [Dragon Tax Return Simulator 2015](https://walsh9.github.io/dragon-taxes/).

## Other Stuff

And here's some non game stuff I made.

### Divining Dust

This little demo was [my entry](http://js1k.com/2017-magic/demo/2830) for the [2017 JS1k competition](http://js1k.com/2017-magic/). Theme: Magic. I didn't make the top ten but I got an [honorable mention](https://twitter.com/js1k/status/843093515424948224).

(Some cool source code here)[https://github.com/walsh9/js1k2017/blob/gh-pages/demo.js].

### Pure CSS Dungeon Doodler

One day I messed around and made [a little tool/toy](https://codepen.io/walsh9/full/KmRzaM/) for sketching out little RPG dungeon maps that runs entirely off of CSS checkbox hacks. It has some display inconsistencies between different computers/browsers/etc and map symbols are limited to what exists in unicode. Because it was built in such a dumb way it's impractical to add more features, but still pretty neat I think.

### ASCIIBot Advent 2017

Last but not least, I once again made a new [ASCIIBot Advent Calendar](http://asciibotics.org/projects/advent2017/)

## Plans for 2018
- Make new things.
- Finish old things.
- Update this blog more?
- Don't stress too much about all of the above.
