I made a little running and jumping game for [GBJAM 5](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5) last week.

![Runjumpers Screenshot](/i/runjumpers04.gif)

It's a finite-runner with 5 levels and a character creator.

[z] to jump.
[x] to hop.

You can play [here](https://walsh9.github.io/runjumpers/) or [here](https://walsh9.itch.io/runjumpers).
