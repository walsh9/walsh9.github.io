Been working on this for a while. It&#8217;s a drawing and animation toy. I designed it to look and function like an old school LCD electronic toy from the 80s/90s.

You can create 2-color, 16&#215;32 pixel, four frame animations and export them as gifs.

It&#8217;s pretty fun. [Check it out.][1]

It&#8217;s also [on Twitter][2].
