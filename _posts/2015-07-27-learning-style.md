As part of the Dev Bootcamp pre-curriculum we were asked to evaluate our learning styles using the Gregorc mind style test. I'll be honest, the test itself seems kind of sketchy to me, like a horoscope. One of those things where it's easy for anyone to find at least something to agree with about each category. Actually, after looking at Mr. Gregorc's website, I get the impression that he has some rather unusual and extreme views on this subject. In any case, the categories and ideas used by the test are still interesting to think about.

Let's see where I fit in. According to this test my highest categories were Abstract Sequential, followed closely by Concrete Random. So I'll focus on things from those two categories and pick out some qualities I agree with.  

I like analyzing things, using logic, experimenting, and solving problems on my own. And I learn best working alone, when I have access to references, and when I'm able to use trial-and-error to solve problems. These parts seem like pretty good descriptions. When I'm working on solo assignments for Dev Bootcamp I do enjoy figuring out different ways to solve the problems. And when I get stuck I'll go to the books or the Ruby docs. And I even like testing solutions in irb before running the provided rspec tests.

That's all well and good, but what do I need to work on more? Let's start with "'sentimental' thinking" and "showing how they got an answer". I definitely have problems putting my thoughts into writing, whether it's in the blog posts, the reflections, or even the feedback.

I feel like this is a case of practice makes perfect. I know Dev Bootcamp emphasizes writing out your thoughts as a part of the learning experience. So luckily for me, I'm forced to do these things on a regular basis. I think as long as I'm aware of this weakness and put in some extra effort each time, I'll be able to grow in this area.
