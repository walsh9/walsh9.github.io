Today I released another update to [Bisby's Escape](http://walsh9.github.io/7drl2016/) for the 2016 [Annual Roguelike Release Party](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=The_annual_roguelike_release_party).

This verion adds walls to get in your way, two new types of crates, and bug fixes.  It also removes an old crate type that was too boring.
