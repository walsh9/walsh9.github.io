Problem: LED USA flag sign looks like this.

Let's open it up and look inside.

Beautiful.

Okay. Let's test along all circuits for continuity by poking with our Hi-tech LED Testing Tool.

Sorry. This post was not intended as any sort of buzz marketing. Any brand of battery will work, I promise.

The tool can test 3 or 4 LEDs at a time. Some of the bad LEDs break the circuit, and others just don't light up. For now, mark all the bad LEDs.

Permanent markers are a great repair tool.

Okay, now snip out all the bad LEDs and solder in new ones.

There were a lot of bad LEDs. I saw some dents on a few of them. I think what happened was the sign took a hard fall at some point.

Apparently, this type of short stubby LED is sometimes called a 'straw hat'.

The new LEDs are a little brighter than the old ones, but from a distance it should be fine.

Looks good!
