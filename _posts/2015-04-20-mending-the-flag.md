Problem: LED USA flag sign looks like this.

Let&#8217;s open it up and look inside.<figure id="attachment_91" style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

&nbsp;

Okay. Let&#8217;s test along all circuits for continuity by poking with our Hi-tech LED Testing Tool.<figure id="attachment_92" style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

This post was not intended as any sort of buzz marketing. Any brand of battery will work, I promise.</figcaption></figure> 

&nbsp;

The tool can test 3 or 4 LEDs at a time. Some of the bad LEDs break the circuit, and others just don&#8217;t light up. For now, mark all the bad LEDs.<figure id="attachment_93" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

&nbsp;

Okay, now snip out all the bad LEDs and solder in new ones.

There were a lot of bad LEDs. I saw some dents on a few of them. I think what happened was the sign took a hard fall at some point.<figure id="attachment_101" style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

&nbsp;

The new LEDs are a little brighter than the old ones, but from a distance it should be fine.
