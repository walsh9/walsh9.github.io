2016 wasn't all bad. I made some cool stuff at least.

## Games

So, I fell short of my goal of making five games this year. But I did make three! I think they're pretty neat.

### Bisby's Escape

I've been calling this one a turn-based digdug-like. I made it for this year's [7-day roguelike challenge](http://7drl.org/about/). It's really hard! For me at least. I'm actually not even sure it's always winnable but I'm not good enough to tell.

### yoctoPets

This is a simulated virtual pet where you can glitch out the game by feeding the pet weird food. I made it for this year's [js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com/) competition.

### Runjumpers

This is an automatic runner where you have two different jump buttons. I really just wanted to make a character creator and then I added the game after, but I think the game part is pretty fun too. I made this one for [GBJAM5](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5).

## Other Stuff

I made some things that aren't games too.

### ASCIIbot Advent Calendar 2016

Another year, another collection of ASCII robots.

### Hey, look at this

I made a [poor-man's-Storify](http://walsh9.github.io/hey-look-at-this/) tool called 'Hey, look at this.'.

Paste a few links like this:

![Screenshot of 'Hey, look at this' app](/i/2016-heylook.png)

And get a link that shows the embeds like this:

### NanoKONTROL2 fractal tree controls

I put together a [thing where you can play with fractal trees](/projects/nanokontroltrees) with the Korg nanoKONTROL2.

## Plans for 2017

You can call them resolutions if you want.

### Runjumpers Update with Background Music
I have two tunes done, but I still need to make a song for the actual gameplay part.
Here's the music for character creation:

### Unnamed Print Shop Clone

I'm working on a [Print Shop](https://archive.org/details/The_Print_Shop_1984_Broderbund)-like greeting card creation web app. I still haven't even named it yet but you edit a card like this:

And it prints out a quad fold card page like this:

### Hypermolen

I have an unfinished game where you control a hyperdimensional mini-golf windmill that I need to polish up and finish.

### More game jams

I plan to do at least the [7-day rougelike challenge](http://7drl.org/about/) again assuming real life doesn't interfere with that week. Would like do some other game jams too. I'm going to try to keep on top of things this year so I can work them into my schedule instead of being caught by surprise.

### Hardware hacking

I'd like to mess around with hardware a bit more this year. Want to do at least one or two of these:

* Finally assemble my [Bleep Labs](http://bleeplabs.com/) [Thingamagoop](http://bleeplabs.com/store/thingamagoop-2x/) kit. 
* Squeeze a Raspberry Pi into a [chumby one](http://www.thechumbystore.com/chumby-one-used/) case. 
* Make a hardware component to display [Super Micro Paint](https://walsh9.github.io/super-micro-paint/) output.
* Something else???

## Until next year...
