So the other weekend I attended the [2016 International Rogulike Development Conference](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=IRDC_2016-usa). Had a really good time. Some highlights:

* [Jason Grinblat](https://twitter.com/ptychomancer)'s [talk](https://www.twitch.tv/roguelike_con/v/82084267) ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pAW4WGYrrY46UPVGLinhao-BJIHenr7T7kUmTZEXgrQ/edit#slide=id.g160567ace3_1_176)) on using Markov chains to create procedurally generated books in [Caves of Qud](http://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/). I especially liked the idea of adding PCG clues into the Markov chain to make researching in these books an actual gameplay mechanic. Also, I never realized Markov chains were actually so simple to get started with. Makes me want to make some sort of bot or web toy that uses procedural text.

* [Jeremaiah Reid](https://twitter.com/humbit)'s [talk about Time Travel](https://www.twitch.tv/roguelike_con/v/82270325) ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c2yuA8Gji-NqrOFZ2kIWdA4GQMiRAeYsTuYgQHM4hJ0/edit#slide=id.p4)) in [The Only Shadow That The Desert Knows](http://humbit.com/shadow/). The challenges of creating not only a time travel system but thousands of years of PCG history to travel through were fascinating.

* Playing [Killer Queen](http://killerqueenarcade.com/) during the breaks. Not a roguelike but the machine was there in the NYU game center and how could anyone resist such a neat game.

* [Brian Bucklew](https://twitter.com/unormal)'s [talk](https://www.twitch.tv/roguelike_con/v/82275370) ([slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zuc1hfyrfsb96ca/IRDC%202016.pdf?dl=0)) on Caves of Qud AI. The part about how they made AI able to semi-intelligently use items without coding a huge nested `if` block kind of makes me want to make a game with items.

* And of course meeting new and upcoming roguelike developers and getting to check out some of their cool works-in-progress was awesome.

[Roguelike Celebration](https://roguelike.club/) is coming up on September... The speaker list looks amazing. I really want to go but not sure if making a weekend trip all the way to SF is something that will happen. Might have to settle for watching the live stream. We'll see.
