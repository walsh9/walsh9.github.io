            <h3>Week One</h3>
            <p>
              As week one of Dev Bootcamp comes to a close, I can't help but reflect on why I'm here. I watched a 'fireside chat' video featuring Shereef Bishay, one of Dev Bootcamp's founders. One point he made that stood out for me was that coding is only a small part of what being a good developer is about. I mean, it's easy to have a growth mindset about coding. It's just a skill to be learned. What's harder to remember is that things like teamwork, communication, and mindfulness are also areas with room for growth. For example, it's all too easy to accept something like "I work better alone", instead of acknowledging that teamwork is something to be learned and practiced just like any other skill.

              Sure, given a few months, I could probaby go through a bunch of books and tutorials and teach myself Ruby. But I'm not here just to learn Ruby. I'm here to learn about how to work with a team. How to be a part of the developer community. How to grow as an individual and a professional. And I've got to push myself to grow in all these areas just as much as I put effort into learning coding. The good news is I'm going to be learning all these things together with a bunch of other bright motivated people.

              That said, I can't help but be nervous about the pair programming assignments. But I'm also looking forward to them. I've never done any pair programming before, and I have only this vague idea of how it works. But even if I have some trouble along the way, I'm going to try my best to learn from my mistakes. Because it's not just about learning, it's about getting in the right mindset. And what you get out of an experience really depends on what you bring into it.
