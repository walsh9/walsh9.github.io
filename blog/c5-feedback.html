            <h3>Pairing and Feedback</h3>
<p>Back when I was trying to decide which coding boot camp to attend, Dev Bootcamp's focus on pair programming played a significant part in my decision. My previous programming experience had been limited entirely to solo coding, but I was well-aware that learning to collaborate with other programmers in pairs and in groups would be a valuable skill to cultivate. And furthermore, it wasn't really something I could just pick up on my own.</p>

<p>Dev Bootcamp begins with a 9-week remote phase that requires pair programming via Google Hangouts several times each week. When I first began I was pretty nervous about this. I mean just calling up a total stranger and working on a programming problem together is pretty weird, right? And there's video chat? Ugh... But it surprised me how quickly I got used to it. After just two or three times, it started to seem like just a normal thing. I mean it didn't always go perfectly but it was a familiar routine.</p>

<p>One thing I really like about pair programming is it forces me to explain my thoughts. This is something I definitely need practice with, but being forced to articulate my ideas helps keep me honest about how much I actually understand. If I don't understand what I'm trying to do well enough to explain it to someone else, that's a good sign that maybe I need to think through things more carefully or try a different approach. And of course my pairs come up with great ideas, catch mistakes I've missed, and teach me things I didn't know. Overall, it's a good experience.</p>

<p>Dev Bootcamp places a strong emphasis on feedback. After each pairing session, both pairs leave semi-anonymous feedback for each other on a special online portal just for feedback. I learned a lot from reading the feedback others left for me. And I think I learned just as much from leaving feedback for others. When I was looking back on the pairing sessions while trying to think about what feedback to leave for my partner, I often noticed areas where I had trouble myself.</p>

<p>One thing I definitely need to work on is rushing ahead to try an idea without giving my partner a chance to think through their own solution. I like to experiment and can't wait to try things out, but sometimes I need to hang back and give my partner some room to think without me interrupting. And to be honest, sometimes my own ideas aren't even completely formed and could benefit from some more thinking time anyway.</p>

<p>Overall, I think pair programming and the feedback I give and receive are pushing me to understand the material more thoroughly than I might from just working on problems on my own. It's also forcing me to be more aware of how I solve problems and how I work with others. I have a lot to think about.</p>
