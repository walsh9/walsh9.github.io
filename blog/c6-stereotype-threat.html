            <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>

<p>I understand that stereotypes can cause people to face diminished social and economic opportunities in their lives because of the way people view them. But even when people from stereotyped groups are part of an even socioeconomic playing field, there are other factors that may hinder them. I was surprised to learn that simply being aware of negative stereotypes can put a person at a real disadvantage.</p>

<p>In 1995, Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson performed an experiment where they had African American and European American students take a difficult verbal test. When they told the students that this was a test to measure intelligence, the African American students underperformed when compared to the European American students, controlled for previous SAT scores. But when they told the students that this test was simply a puzzle with no ability to diagnose intelligence, the African American students performed equally well when compared to the European American students. Steele and Aronson called this effect stereotype threat.</p>

<p>Stereotype threat occurs when a situation puts a person at risk for confirming a negative stereotype for their group. When a person knows they're under the pressure of a negative stereotype, anxiety about confirming the stereotype creates stress. The person may face extra pressure to perform, or may have nagging worries that they are being viewed more harshly due to the stereotype. Either way, they are subconsciously distracted from the task at hand and their performance can suffer for it.</p>

<p>Steele and Aaronson's study was reproduced many times, and effects were shown for many different groups across several different domains. Women underperformed in math test when they felt they were being compared to men. European Americans underperformed against African Americans in athletic challenges when they thought their natural athletic ability was being measured. Any group with a stereotype about it can be affected.</p>

<p>Fortunately, several things can be done to reduce this insidious effect. One is to reduce environmental cues that emphasize factors linked to stereotypes. For example, a tech event with no women speakers isn't going to make women attendees feel like they belong there. To put it another way, make sure your environment is welcoming to all groups. The second important factor is to encourage communication between groups. When members of a stereotyped group are isolated, they can get caught up in worries that the difficulties they face are due to the stereotype. But open communication lets everyone know when they share the same difficulties, regardless of the group they belong to.</p>

<p>I think Dev Bootcamp is trying their best to limit these effects. They encourage diversity and promote the idea that anyone can program, no matter their background. Furthermore, they not only encourage open communication between students, they require it. I'm looking forward to learning more here and seeing what my fellow students accomplish.</p>
