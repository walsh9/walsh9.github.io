<!-- When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?

Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:

In general, I try to live up to these values:

Disagree 1  2  3  4  5 Agree

Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you.

What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?

How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?

Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC? -->


I love the feeling I get when I finish some goal or project that I set out for myself. But it's more complicated than that. I also love to dither on incomplete projects, add little things to finished projects, and plan out new ones.

Now, I don't always live up to this. Like many people I have many more projects started than I've ever finished. And even more that have never been started. I think I value facing challenges just as much or more than the accomplishment from overcoming them. Either way if I learn something that's great.
