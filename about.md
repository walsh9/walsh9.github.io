My name is Matt Walsh and I'm currently enrolled in [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com). I'm working my way through the remote 'Phase 0' curriculum now, and I'll be attending at the NYC site this September.

I consider myself a pretty okay solo front-end/Javascript hacker. But I'm trying to become a well-rounded developer with more full-stack knowledge and team experience. I'll have blog posts here about what I learn, my experiences with Dev Bootcamp, and more.

I believe there's a lot more to being a good developer than simply knowing how to code. And I'm optimistic that my experiences at Dev Bootcamp will help lead me on that path.

As for other interests, I enjoy computer games, especially [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) games. I've beaten [Nethack](http://www.nethack.org) once, and [Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup](https://crawl.develz.org) three times. I even made <a href="http://7drl.org/2015/03/16/chitinous-crooks-success/">my own little roguelike</a> once for the 2015 [7drl challenge](http://7drl.org/about/).

I also draw ASCII art from time to time. Here's a robot.

             '-=-=-=-'"         '-=-=-=-'" 

And when I'm away from the computer entirely, I enjoy playing card games with my cousin and walking the dogs through the parks and woods around the neighborhood.
