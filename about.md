My name is Matt Walsh and I'm a Web Developer in the Greater NYC Area. My favorite thing about making things for the web is it's so easy to share the results. My favorite HTML element lately has got to be canvas. It's fun to make [cool pixel-by-pixel graphical effects](https://github.com/walsh9/fun-with-canvas) or just do [neat stuff with line drawing](https://github.com/walsh9/topiary).

I also enjoy playing and making computer games. Recently, I made the old-school ASCII roguelike, [Chitinous Crooks](https://github.com/walsh9/7drl2015), for the 2015 [7DRL Challenge](http://7drl.org/about/), and I made the fantasy paperwork simulation, [Dragon Tax Return Simulator 2015](https://github.com/walsh9/dragon-taxes), for the [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/) 33 game jam.

When I'm away from the computer entirely, I like to relax by playing the cooperative card-games with my cousin or walking the dogs through the parks and woods around the neighborhood.
