I'm Matt Walsh, a Web Developer in the Greater NYC Area. I love making things for the web because it's so easy to share the results. My favorite HTML element is canvas because you can do cool things with it like make [pixel-by-pixel graphical effects](https://github.com/walsh9/fun-with-canvas) or do [neat stuff with line drawing](https://github.com/walsh9/topiary).

I also enjoy playing and making computer games. You can see what I've been working on lately on my [games](/games/) page.

When I'm away from the computer entirely, I like to relax by playing card games or walking the dogs.
